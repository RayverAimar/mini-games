There should be a function which frezees the program when waiting for an input (movement).
If the input is a invalid one, then ask for new input instead of running the while again.
So there would be no error when reaching to number of movements needed to "end the program"
and putting a non-valid input would make the program show the message again.
Steps to make the error appear:
1. Do 500 movements
2. Enter "y"
3. Press any other key instead of "w a s d"

The same message will appear even after put "y" LMAO
